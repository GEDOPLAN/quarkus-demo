Demo project for Quarkus

Modules::

This is a multi-module project. 
Every module shows some aspect/feature/extension of Quarkus.
+
Details can be found in `README.adoc` in the module subdirectories - sorry, only some modules have one ...

Issues::

The project has been upgraded to Quarkus 3. There are some (minor?) malfunctions:
+
* After a hot reload in dev mode, the MyFaces extension throws a NPE for each refresh: +
`java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "jakarta.faces.render.RenderKit.getResponseStateManager()" because the return value of "jakarta.faces.render.RenderKitFactory.getRenderKit(jakarta.faces.context.FacesContext, String)" is null` +
Most probably this is not a Quarkus problem but a bug in MyFaces.
